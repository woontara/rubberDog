00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.470
hello

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.774
This is Danang Morning

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:12.712
It's okay to do it when it comes out, and
the tree is so pretty, so it feels good

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.915
I have to move my accommodation today

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:21.087
I'll just hit Banh Mi quickly

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.824
This is now the Gozar Cafe

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.595
It's popular with long-term travelers and
locals because

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.598
it's delicious, so I'll go, wait, banh
mi.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.568
This is because it is so emotional that
it is an outer seat

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.404
It's hot outside...

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.673
The air conditioner is a bit generous
(passed)

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.877
Coconut coffee is also famous, but please
don't have sweet coffee.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.746
Fried Egg&amp; Beef(3300)

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:47.347
High

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.884
Iced cappuccino (2600) Please cappuccino
iced OK

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.552
Alas, don't go

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.021
Diss= Fried Egg&amp; Beef (3300) Please

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.623
Finally

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.496
A kind and cute girl leaves shyly

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.302
Did it come out a lot? I ordered one of
these,

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.305
but I wanted to try something like this

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.306
Uh, warm

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:17.277
I can see this feeling other than a
sandwich, so Chulai

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:21.748
banh mi (rice baguette) is really... It's
delicious

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.749
Crispy

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.087
Familiar taste of steak sauce

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.057
Eat this egg on top rather than meat

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:33.827
It was delicious, it was delicious

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.662
Lulu Lala

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:42.735
Basasak

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.005
~I'm moving~

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:52.378
... I still haven't seen Hakamikevich

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.816
Is it there...??

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.953
You came out to greet me

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:00.954
It's cool

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.060
I'll check your passport.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.628
Oh okay

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.263
Dumneyoung...

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.599
Herongherong your room is ready (before
check-in)

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.266
Five!!

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.535
It's a very...

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:19.739
I was just thirsty, but they gave me a
drink.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.611
Words

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.848
Oh, right in front of ha ha

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:42.862
As soon as I arrived, the room was very
nice because I checked in

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:46.933
early, and this place definitely feels
more like an apartment (good)

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.935
There is also a pot

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.775
There are really many tables.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:59.045
There is an outlet, slippers, and a place
to hang clothes, and there is a pool and

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.680
gym here.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.682
Because it's an ocean view like this

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.623
The sea is close

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:20.433
The view is better than I thought

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:23.036
Actually, it's not right in front of me.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:28.441
It was called an ocean view room, but I
didn't think it would look so big

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.878
It's closer than I thought

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.414
It looks very good, the sea is so
beautiful today because the weather is

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.682
nice

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.317
Urban and

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.420
By the way, there are all the tableware

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:42.021
come

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.357
There is also a bathtub

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.792
sensation

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.665
Dryer? Dryer? Actually?

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:56.436
It was very cheap, but it's only about
half price.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.705
Completely satisfied with both

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:04.477
Nearby Kong Cafe

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:08.348
I'm also a polite person, so when I come
to Vietnam, I have to go to the Kong cafÃ©

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.316
again.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.719
It's not polite, it's not polite.

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.290
By the way, this point...?

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.827
The atmosphere is very different from the
Korean restaurant I went to before.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:23.162
Well, only high-end districts

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.501
Please have a large coconut smoothie
(3600)

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.103
yes

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:35.341
Oh finally,

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:40.246
I think this branch is definitely good
Kong Cafe seems to have a little more

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.248
delicious coffee.

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:45.118
The coconut tastes good too

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.253
Ice particles chew

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:50.456
Caffeine and sugar are well collected.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.393
Now, let's finally go to Han Market.

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:56.529
It seems like a very good seat, but I
couldn't sit in the yard seat because

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.864
it's

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:01.868
summer. This time, there is an app called
In-Drive, so I'm going to ride it. Locals

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:05.872
say they use it a lot, but it's cheaper,
and you can negotiate the price (easy) I

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.509
think there are a lot of drivers who use
both apps, but Grab is more trustworthy.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:12.712
Dragon bridge!

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:17.250
I can't see it any closer than this. If
you cross the Han River like this

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.887
You will arrive at Han Market right away

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.658
The driver walks exquisitely slowly

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:32.031
Arrive at the near-visible destination,
the currency exchange office

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.133
Dingku

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:38.104
Exchange office in front of Han Market,
arrival at Soanha

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.341
By the way, it used to be a gold and
silver room...

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:45.311
It seems to have become a currency
exchange office specializing in

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:49.315
Koreans, but they still check it in
Korean 100,000 won= 1.88 million

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:53.319
dong, and the same exchange rate as Kim
Mai Kim that I went to the last

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.556
episode must have had money. No,
departing for Han Market

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.594
The first floor has a lot of jelly and
groceries, and most of them go to the

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:02.895
second floor. The first floor

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.698
has a lot of jelly and groceries, and
most of them go to the second floor. The

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.468
second floor is a fashion corner (shoes,
bags, clothing, ao dai, etc.)

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:16.075
There are a little bit of similar items
crowded

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:20.079
There are places that sew them right
away, like

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:24.083
Dongdaemun The store I came to last time
is near No.

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:27.487
143, and this area is almost a scouting
system.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:32.792
Nowadays, I notice that I buy a lot of
street T-shirts ðŸ˜‰

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:37.964
Now it's time to move to today's
destination Trash Pa area...

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:41.968
I came with a prickly peel

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:45.638
If we continue like this, we will not be
able to avoid the risk of being like a

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.473
pig's foot

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.711
1. Eco Zego (15000)

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.514
2. Basic (7800)

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:57.817
Well, it's a bit disappointing, but 3.
This is also an eco-friendly (15000)

00:06:58.518 --> 00:06:59.819
No...

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:00.853
omission

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:01.888
and

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.357
I found it.

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.759
Bokdeokbang Core... Go Core...

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:10.730
Oh, but I don't have a women's size, I'm
waiting for you, I'm just going to

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.734
wear it bigger, I bought it in the
smallest size (probably 250), and I'm

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.736
looking for a very busy employee girl.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:18.638
This is 250,000 VND

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:20.339
Because I'm pretty disoriented

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.409
If possible, pay the money according to
the

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.045
It is recommended to take a picture of
the calculation like this, and since this

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.380
is

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.384
literally the market, 1. Check the amount
of cash you have before entering (take a

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:34.053
photo) 2. When I checked to see if the
price was correct, I said 'please'

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:35.388
because it was

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:38.057
100,000 dong, but it was 130,000 dong at
checkout! Did I misunderstand? It turned

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.392
out

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:42.195
to be... I was confused even though I
knew this, and finally 3. When you

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:45.031
receive change, check the amount and unit
carefully~!

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:49.902
Now, if you come to the back of the first
floor, there is a food

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:53.673
court, famous restaurants, bean cafes,
and utik (cafes).

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:57.844
I should go to Utique and eat a mango

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:01.681
But I heard that juice and things like
this are fine,

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:04.684
but now I really need an air conditioner

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:08.421
The Han River that you can see as soon as
you come out

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.592
I was on my way to eat Ayu Mango
Smoothie...

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:15.495
There's a mill...

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.698
He's pretty too, hello sinchao~ Hi~ How
much is it?

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:22.668
This is 130,000 dong (6,700) 130,000 dong
- What is this?

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:26.539
Is this expensive, 250,000 dong (13,000)
expensive? ha ha big! (Because it's big)

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.508
ha ha ha ha you're cute

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:32.578
I think you're kind and pretty

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:36.182
I wanted to buy a hat, but it didn't fit
me and it was an issue...!

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.953
Shin Chao~ Howmani People?

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.221
One Pulson

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.861
When you go to Han Market

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.764
Coconut... Mango... I can't help but
choose Utique with good location, taste,

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:54.700
and temperature (air conditioning) There
is also an air-conditioned room

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.071
Here.. It's an old sewing table

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.975
One Mango Smoothie (3300) Pleasure

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:09.582
A fine smoothie with fresh mango on top

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.563
It's the Pink Cathedral!

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:28.167
Oh... Bells

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.507
It's a spherical and not a big church, so
I didn't intend to come to see it

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.741
separately.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:39.478
It's good that it's a good day today

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.817
Right next to the church, arrive at the
buncha restaurant

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:52.291
Buncha..! I think you can eat

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.294
buncha One buncha (2600) please.

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:56.128
Endorsement

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:02.068
You this is very hot

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.069
Very hot!

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:04.937
This is spicy~!

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:05.938
Let's eat together?

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.940
Dip that and dip this

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.941
I get it?

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:09.942
Nebkikiki

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.944
Pepper This is spicy~!

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:13.946
Five! DingQ

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.415
Kind...! The impression is also good

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:26.959
All kinds of vegetables, fried spring
rolls, and buncha are very hot.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:32.298
You did it right now?

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:36.569
Each type contains meat (like pork ribs)

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.971
Yes? Delicious!

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:42.475
It's sweet and sour, but it's delicious!

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:48.147
It's really delicious among the things
I've ever eaten.

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.115
+ Rice noodles+ vegetables

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.117
+Lettuce

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:56.155
+Rice noodles um? This is delicious!

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:58.591
Freshly fried spring rolls (steamed)

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:02.128
Spicy sriracha+ mayo

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.262
At that time

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:06.399
Tee! (Drink it) ha ha ha ha The boss gave

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.402

You gave me this and leftha ha

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.939
This is really delicious

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:17.910
I wrapped the crispy beef rolls and
rolled up a bowl of

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.946
buncha spicy, oh, it's delicious here...

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.716
Jasmine tea? It's the same, but it's just
right...!

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:31.457
It's across the street from the last time
I went to the reorganization that I

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:33.359
couldn't do during the corona period.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.594
Da Nang, in the midst of development

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:41.200
A palm spa located right in front of the
Pink Cathedral

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.270
I'm going to do a foot massage

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:55.281
Everywhere you give me those slippers

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:02.788
I'm full... Cool estuaries...

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:07.193
Smells good...!

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:11.931
Welcome tea and coconut sweets that are
always given

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:15.501
The area around Han Market is especially
developed Korean...!

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:18.838
Pleased for an hour (10500) with Foot Hot
Stone~

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:25.644
After a massage

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:30.015
Warm up with a hot stone

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:32.885
And the highlight of this house that
appeared

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.954
He gave me a mango

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:41.961
Mango is delicious?

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:42.795
[Mango Restaurant]

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:44.230
Oa

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:49.935
Sunset and the Pink Cathedral knight
appear

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:53.539
Unusual sunset drive

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.677
Cross the dragon bridge again and go to
Mikevich

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:02.548
Arrival!

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.253
It's strange, what is this?

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:10.923
Is it a traditional performance?

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:17.263
I suddenly thought it would be nice to
see the sea, so I just came right away

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:31.110
I need to have a beer

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:38.317
I think it would be nice to sit here

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.352
(It's actually brighter haha)

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:43.355
Nice relaxing sea atmosphere

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.460
The last time I drank beer here, it was
delicious, right?

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.531
San Miguel raw wheat (2800) please~!

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.200
Is it big?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.634
Yes!

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:01.340
real

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.775
It's so cool!

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:13.452
It's not true dew, it's a good day...!

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:17.690
Arrive at the accommodation!

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:22.595
I'm going to come into the dormitory now,
put the washing machine back, and go

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.330
swimming.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.968
Wow~ The pool is nice here too~

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.171
Charming Building Forest

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:40.913
Duda Dada

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:41.747
Dada-Dada-da

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:55.027
Quick breakfast slurping

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:58.631
Oh, there are more breakfast restaurants
than I expected.

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.399
Vegetables and Vietnamese leaf rice fried
rice and curry

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.167
Potatoes and bacon

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:03.435
Five?????

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:06.505
Oh, there's kimchi...! Is it pickled?

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:08.007
Instant Dishes

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:11.377
You have to eat omelets and pho

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:16.882
I think most hotels serve a variety of
pho in addition to the beef pho we know

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:18.617
Idea

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.620
Emergency... Americano... Emergency...

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.488
I'm going to go

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.358
Ahem

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.327
Yes? I found a house where this was
steamed!!

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:31.397
Reviews Very good banmi house (5 ratings)

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.365
It's time to do it-

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:37.169
Oh, it's steamy here too

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:39.171
It's a nail salon

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.707
I made a reservation and went...!

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:42.608
Korean??

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.276
(Translator setting) Yes- about!

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:48.914
Where is Korean~~~

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.883
Book 1 hour later and break up

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:52.217
(Cute girl)

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:55.154
I made a good reservation and there is a
cafÃ© right in the alley in front of me...

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:56.622
(Where..?)

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.725
Isn't it a residential area...?

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:01.627
Why can't I see it? Is this it?

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:02.895
&lt;- ....

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:04.730
How far are you going...

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.601
... I almost couldn't find it, yes... I
still can't

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:13.272
see the cafÃ© nose, but there is a sign,
so I'll go up

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:16.141
haha Coming out to greet

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:25.985
Oh, that's Pashinabuda~ It seems like
you're mainly doing

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:30.556
drip coffee, so I ordered an iced drip
(3500) I'm very thirsty...?

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:34.526
Five... He will introduce you to each
coffee bean

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:39.264
Ah Ethiopian guna yesyes

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:44.269
Work and ears...

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:50.042
This is a slightly familiar aroma, a
selection of coffee beans recommended by

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:51.777
a few flavors.

00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:53.679
So careful...

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.081
He explained it and went to prepare
something for me.

00:16:57.383 --> 00:17:02.988
He changed the beans to smell the
incense... gosh

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:10.229
! This time, he pecked me down again to
taste it.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.667
Iced coffee finally came out

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:19.838
I think it's so much fun to be served
like this

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:22.174
Hmm~ I think I'll buy it

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.876
I almost died...

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:27.413
It's a little soft for me, but I think
I'll buy it big~

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:35.287
Taltal

00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:40.926
He brought me a cup of this too.

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:43.228
Something like orange coffee

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:47.800
I think it's a coffee cocktail mixed with
lemon and coffee

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.335
Taste of the summer country

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:52.271
After drinking well, it was time to make
an appointment, so I hurried to the nail

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.272
salon

00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:58.243
The store was amazing

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:00.946
Super compact

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.485
It's unique~!

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:09.421
Ah, Vietnamese Dong~! Endorsement!

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:13.092
120,000 dong= about â‚©6200 It's cheap
because it's not a shop where tourists

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.927
usually come!

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:18.897
(You're doing it very carefully) You did
it for the

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:24.203
whole hour, so I think you can understand
why the rating is good.

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:26.171
Buncha Soiwon?

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:29.174
I'm very hungry....

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:33.846
The store is cleaner and more modern than
I expected,

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:37.583
and fortunately there is also a toilet.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:38.584
This thing?

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:39.184
Buncha! yes!

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:40.319
This thing? Is it big??

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:41.320
yes

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:43.422
Lemon Iced Tea (650) is also appreciated

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:52.865
The kitchen is really clean

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.700
Wow~ It's so big

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.937
Is this bigger than Mega Coffee?

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:04.843
The taste of green tea and citrus juice?

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:06.278
It's very sweet

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.414
Buncha Specials (2300)

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.652
Oh, it's coming out

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:16.688
Is this 2,500 won? (No)

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.223
I also had a lot of meat

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:22.227
Hmm~ The meat is delicious

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:24.863
There are really a lot of noodles

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.702
it's delicious

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:32.437
But this is a dorn

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.406
Hey man! Hot!

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:39.011
Oh, this is really delicious, the blood
is thin and really crispy...

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.647
Let's pack up the wrap Let's pack the
wrap

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:49.288
Buncha is like eating pork ribs and hot
cold noodles.

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:53.926
Addictive

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:57.896
I ate it so deliciously (spring roll...)
Are you waiting for a

00:19:57.896 --> 00:20:01.900
motorcycle...? (Today, Da Nang is 35
degrees) If it was a cool day,

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.737
I could have walked around the
neighborhood, but I have 500 won~

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:09.541
Arrive at the nice tea room

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.518
A style that is hard to find in Da Nang

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.920
Tea room with a calm atmosphere

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.288
hi

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.528
Sit at the bar here or
There's a seat
across the street

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:33.065
Oh, then I'll sit here

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:36.201
- You can place your order here

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:42.808
The Vietnamese people explained something
carefully

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.310
Iced Latte (3200)

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.678
Nosuga?

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:48.480
Yes Nosugar Pleases

00:20:56.655 --> 00:21:01.059
I wanted to see the menu being made, so I
went to the bar

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.468
Oh, the matcha crab... Interresting This
has been a lot of fun lately...

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:19.111
Cute

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:23.081
The space is cool and the atmosphere is
calm.

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:26.018
Well drunk

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:30.055
I rested for an hour at the inn, oh, I
need to leave quickly

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:35.861
Now that the sun is setting, let's go
swimming in the sea

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:42.334
After all, I had to come when the sun
came up, so I followed

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:45.337
the uncles across the river, but I got
stuck!

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:48.340
Oh, you should take me with you too.

00:21:50.742 --> 00:21:54.713
The sun has set, so it's just right now,
it's not emerald, but the atmosphere

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:58.717
is comfortable, it's very long, it's very
long, and there are security guards

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:02.521
on the Mikevich basket boat here and
there. I brought a waterproof bag this

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:05.524
time, and you can just hit it all up, tie
it up, and swim.

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:07.025
however

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:09.895
I also left it like this.

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:13.865
I'm going to bring my phone and money in
a waterproof pack and

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:17.869
go in. The waves are made of Caribbean
Bay Mikebchi, and if you

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:21.873
float around without much trouble, you
will come straight to

00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:25.877
the swimming pool of the inn wearing a
honey jam swimsuit.

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:30.415
Oh nice at sunset

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:35.220
It's totally good, it's Netflix

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:39.858
I have to watch that Lee Sook cam
(serious) Oh, I'm here in Vietnam,

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:43.395
so I guess I don't have a Lee Sook cam...
The only reason to

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:46.398
subscribe to Netflix uh, there's a
machine...

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:49.601
I don't even have a sook cam... Noh
meaning, come out to eat

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:55.507
Because Van Xeo wants to eat so much...!

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:58.076
I'm going to drink with Ban Xeo...!

00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.678
1 Ban Xeo (4000)

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:00.779
Endorsement

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:02.781
Please also give me a bottle of beer~

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:03.782
What kind of beer?

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:05.250
What is better?

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.786
Sound... Hudavier?

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:10.789
Okay Fuda (1300) and this is pretty

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:12.791
I guess it's beer here

00:23:18.997 --> 00:23:22.000
It's so carbonated

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:27.439
It's so hot, Van Xeo...!

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:30.175
Five.. Rice paper folded out...!

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:31.042
Weird

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:34.780
Shrimp batter with a little bit of meat
and bean sprouts

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.849
Is it a bit big to eat at once?

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:47.459
Oh.. It's so delicious

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:51.797
Who thought of this

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:54.399
The whole thing is so delicious

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:58.603
Ah, Hudavier...!

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.178
This before? The tempura is so delicious

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:07.813
Splash the dried shrimp batter like
frying it...?

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:11.616
Think about adding meat and vegetables
and eating them again

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:13.218
Who is it~

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:15.854
It's so delicious, even if that beer is
burned on ice, it's carbonated, it's too

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:17.189
summery, it's

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:19.891
too summery, it's too summery, because
there's a banh mi restaurant I saw

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:21.259
earlier in front of me.

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:22.861
I have to be half-maek, half-maek

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:30.502
Forks are popular

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:32.504
Is this so? Is this it?

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:35.307
Do you want to sell beer with this?

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.741

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:39.778

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:54.759
South Korea!

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.094
Ah, Korea is no coriander?

00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:57.195

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:03.134

won

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:17.716
Let's try it, hey, it's full of meat and
cucumbers, right?

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:20.285
The bread is really crispy!

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:24.256
I don't think I'll cut the palate at all,
it's just a

00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:28.927
simple and classic taste, is this the
real half-rice flavor...?

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:32.898
... I love it so much, and sitting on the
street like this and

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:36.501
drinking beer is emotional... Something
like that

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:38.103
It's fun

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:46.478
Right now, if you go to the Seoncha Night
Market (Da Nang's representative

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:50.482
night market) and eat a Hai Khoi
delivery, it's a fantastic course, but I

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:53.552
want to wash it up so much that I'm going
to go in today.

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:10.936
See you next time on your trip to Hoi An
